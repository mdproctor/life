# casehub-life Workspace

**Name:** casehub-life

**Physical path:** /Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/life/CLAUDE.md
**Symlinked at:** /Users/mdproctor/claude/public/casehub/life/CLAUDE.md
**Project repo:** /Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/life
**Workspace:** /Users/mdproctor/claude/public/casehub/life
**Workspace type:** public

## Session Start

Run `add-dir /Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/life` before any other work.

## Artifact Locations

| Skill | Writes to |
|-------|-----------|
| brainstorming (specs) | `specs/` |
| writing-plans (plans) | `plans/` |
| handover | `HANDOFF.md` |
| idea-log | `IDEAS.md` |
| design-snapshot | `snapshots/` |
| java-update-design / update-primary-doc | `design/JOURNAL.md` (created by `epic`) |
| adr | `adr/` |
| write-blog | `blog/` |

## Structure

- `HANDOFF.md` — session handover (single file, overwritten each session)
- `IDEAS.md` — idea log (single file)
- `specs/` — brainstorming / design specs (superpowers output)
- `plans/` — implementation plans (superpowers output)
- `snapshots/` — design snapshots with INDEX.md (auto-pruned, max 10)
- `adr/` — architecture decision records with INDEX.md
- `blog/` — project diary entries with INDEX.md
- `design/` — epic journal (created by `epic` at branch start)

## Git Discipline

Two git repositories are active in every session:
- **Workspace** (`/Users/mdproctor/claude/public/casehub/life`) — methodology artifacts: handover, blog, specs, plans, ADRs
- **Project repo** (`/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/life`) — source code

Before any git operation, run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to confirm which repo is currently active. Do not assume — the session may have opened in either. cd to the correct repo before staging:
- Source code commits → project repo
- Methodology artifacts → workspace


## Rules

- All methodology artifacts go here, not in the project repo
- Promotion to project repo is always explicit — never automatic
- Workspace branches mirror project branches — switch both together

## Peer Repos — Hard Boundary

**This session owns exactly two repos: the workspace and the project repo.**
Every other casehubio repo is a peer repo with its own Claude session.

Peer repos (never commit or push to these from this session):
- `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/parent` and all paths under it
- `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/engine`
- `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/ledger`
- `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/work`
- `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/qhorus`
- `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/connectors`
- `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/devtown`
- `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/aml`
- `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/clinical`
- `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/openclaw` (casehub-openclaw)
- Any other sibling directory under `/Users/mdproctor/claude/casehub/`

**When a cross-repo doc change is needed** (e.g. `docs/PLATFORM.md`,
`docs/repos/casehub-life.md` in the parent): file a GitHub issue on
`casehubio/parent` describing the change — never edit or commit directly.

Skills that check this (implementation-doc-sync, work-end, handover) must
read this section before deciding where to commit doc changes.

## Routing

# casehub-life — Claude Code Project Guide

## Platform Context

This repo is one component of the casehubio multi-repo platform. **Before implementing anything — any feature, SPI, data model, or abstraction — run the Platform Coherence Protocol.**

> **Platform docs:** Local paths use `../parent/docs/` as root. If a path doesn't exist, the parent repo isn't cloned locally — fetch from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casehubio/parent/main/docs/<path>` instead.

The protocol asks: Does this already exist elsewhere? Is this the right repo for it? Does this create a consolidation opportunity? Is this consistent with how the platform handles the same concern in other repos?

## Platform Docs
- [Platform Index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casehubio/parent/main/docs/INDEX.md) — discovery index (start here)
- [Building Apps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casehubio/parent/main/docs/guides/building-apps.md) — app developer guide with cross-app patterns
- [This repo's deep-dive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casehubio/parent/main/docs/repos/casehub-life.md)

## Project Type

type: java

**Stack:** Java 21 (on Java 26 JVM), Quarkus 3.32.2

---

## Agentic Harness Goals

**Read first:** `../parent/docs/AGENTIC-HARNESS-GUIDE.md`

**Goal:** Production-grade personal life automation harness demonstrating that household coordination, health management, family obligations, and legal compliance are structurally better served by a formal accountability layer than by best-effort automation tools.

**Architecture record:** `ARC42STORIES.MD` is the primary architecture document (Arc42Stories v0.1, CaseHub Profile). `LAYER-LOG.md` retained as source-of-truth draft. A layer is not complete until its §9.4 entry in `ARC42STORIES.MD` is written. See `../parent/docs/arc42stories-spec.md` and `../parent/docs/arc42stories-casehub-profile.md`.

---

## What This Project Is

`casehub-life` is a **personal life automation harness** built on the CaseHub platform foundation. It coordinates household management agents, health coordination agents, financial governance agents, elder/family care agents — producing a formally tracked, SLA-enforced, tamper-evident record of life obligations and decisions.

This is an **application layer**, not a framework. The foundation (casehub-engine, casehub-qhorus, casehub-ledger, casehub-work, casehub-connectors) provides coordination, accountability, audit, and compliance primitives. casehub-life provides the personal life domain logic: what a household task is, how a care coordination cycle proceeds, which family members have decision authority, and how a major financial decision requires human sign-off before action.

### Why Personal Life Automation

Personal life has domains where CaseHub's accountability properties are structurally required: contractor commitments routinely go unfulfilled without a Watchdog, health follow-ups are forgotten without SLA enforcement, family obligations evaporate without commitment tracking, legal deadlines arrive without escalation.

### Accountability Properties Delivered

| Domain | Without CaseHub | With casehub-life |
|---|---|---|
| Contractor follow-up | Silent if commitment not met | Commitment + Watchdog; automated SMS via messaging skill if no ETA |
| Health appointment | Reminder sent, then forgotten | WorkItem with SLA deadline; escalation to named GP |
| Monthly grocery SLA | May fail silently | WorkItem with deadline and escalation |
| Major financial decision | No approval gate | Oversight channel; human RESPONSE required before any action |
| Legal deadline | Calendar reminder only | WorkItem with hard deadline + tamper-evident ledger record |

---

## Layering Rule

This is an application, not a framework. If the capability requires knowledge of household domains, health protocols, personal finance rules, or family obligation tracking, it belongs here. If it is purely about cases, commitments, trust, or audit records, it belongs in the foundation. Never re-implement foundation primitives here.

## Design Phase References

Read these **before designing**, not after. The concern column tells you when each applies.

### Domain model and API design

| Concern | Read first |
|---------|-----------|
| Designing a new entity, record, or SPI | `docs/specs/life-automation.md` — does life already own this? `PLATFORM.md` capability ownership table — does the foundation own it? |
| Deciding api vs app module placement | `PLATFORM.md` persistence module split rule — JPA-free api, JPA in app. |
| Naming capability tags or trust dimensions | This CLAUDE.md §What This Project Owns — existing tag and dimension names |
| Choosing which life domain a feature belongs to | `LifeDomain` enum values in `api/` — routing logic ties capability tags to domains |

### Layer design

| Concern | Read first |
|---------|-----------|
| Deciding which layer a feature belongs in | Foundation Layers section below — layer ownership boundaries |
| Documenting a completed layer | ARC42STORIES.MD §9.4 — write the layer entry before closing the issue (LAYER-LOG.md is the draft) |

### Foundation integration

| Concern | Read first |
|---------|-----------|
| Using casehub-work (WorkItem, SLA, escalation) | `../parent/docs/repos/casehub-work.md` |
| Using casehub-qhorus (COMMAND/RESPONSE/DONE/DECLINE, Commitment) | `../parent/docs/repos/casehub-qhorus.md` |
| Using casehub-ledger (Merkle audit, GDPR erasure, LedgerEntry subclasses) | `../parent/docs/repos/casehub-ledger.md` |
| Using casehub-engine (CasePlanModel, bindings, sub-cases) | `../parent/docs/repos/casehub-engine.md` |
| Using casehub-openclaw (WorkerProvisioner, skill ecosystem) | Research spec `../parent/docs/specs/2026-05-25-openclaw-casehub-integration.md` |
| Boundary check — foundation or life? | `PLATFORM.md` boundary rules; Layering Rule section in this file |

### Persistence and migrations

| Concern | Read first |
|---------|-----------|
| Writing a new Flyway migration | `../garden/docs/protocols/universal/flyway-migration-rules.md` — naming, H2 MODE=PostgreSQL |
| Assigning a migration version number | Domain migrations start at V100 (casehub-work occupies V1–V21+) |
| Adding casehub-ledger to the classpath | PP-20260524-10efef — add `classpath:db/ledger/migration` to Flyway locations |
| Adding casehub-qhorus to the classpath | Add `classpath:db/qhorus/migration` to Flyway locations |
| Extending LedgerEntry (adding a tamper-evident subclass) | `casehub-ledger.md` Consumer Pattern section — JOINED inheritance, V2001+ migration. **Override `domainContentBytes()`** — join all persistent fields with `\|` separator, return as UTF-8 bytes. Build-time validator enforces this; test in same package (protected access). See `LedgerEntryDomainContentBytesTest`. |

### Testing

| Concern | Read first |
|---------|-----------|
| Writing a `@QuarkusTest` | `../garden/docs/protocols/universal/quarkus-test-database.md` — H2 MODE=PostgreSQL, datasource config |
| Testing SPI wiring | `spi-testing-alternative-inner-classes` protocol |
| Testing a WorkItem SLA | WorkItem test patterns in `casehub-work.md` |
| Seeding WorkItemTemplates in tests | Flyway is disabled in tests (`migrate-at-start=false`). Seed templates via `LifeTestFixtures.seedStandardTemplates()` and/or `LifeTestFixtures.seedEscalationTemplate()` from `@BeforeEach @Transactional`. Canonical UUIDs 001–004; idempotency guard by template name. **Always set `tenancyId` to `"278776f9-e1b0-46fb-9032-8bddebdcf9ce"` — V35 adds NOT NULL with no H2 default.** See `app/src/test/java/io/casehub/life/app/LifeTestFixtures.java`. |
| Non-JPA plain SQL tables in H2 tests | Hibernate `drop-and-create` only creates JPA entity tables. Plain SQL tables (e.g. `ledger_subject_sequence`) must be created via `quarkus.hibernate-orm."<pu>".sql-load-script` pointing to a SQL file with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. See `app/src/test/resources/import-qhorus.sql` and PP-20260609-e2c3a1. **When the ledger SNAPSHOT changes `ledger_subject_sequence` schema** (e.g. adding `tenancy_id` column in composite PK), update `import-qhorus.sql` to match — mismatch causes "Column not found" HTTP 500 on any ledger write. |
| Testing LedgerErasureService integration | Enable `casehub.ledger.identity.tokenisation.enabled=true` and `casehub.ledger.erasure-receipt.enabled=true` in test config (GE-20260531-46f8ab). Maven: exclude `casehub-qhorus-persistence-memory` from `casehub-qhorus-testing` dep (GE-20260630-69e447 — duplicate `@Alternative @Priority(1)` stores cause 35 CDI ambiguity errors). |
| Testing async CDI observers | Call the observer method directly through the injected CDI proxy — bypasses event dispatch and debounce. Method-level `@Transactional(REQUIRES_NEW)` is honoured via CDI proxy. Do NOT use `@TestTransaction` on the test method — it blocks the REQUIRES_NEW from seeing committed setup records. See GE-20260529-9f3557 and `LifeWatchdogAlertObserverTest`. |
| Testing ledger writers (unit) | Mock `LedgerEntryRepository` with Mockito. Do NOT assert on `entry.id` or `entry.occurredAt` — these are set by `LedgerEntry.@PrePersist` which is bypassed in mocked tests. See `LifeLedgerWriterTest`. |
| Mocking CDI beans in `@QuarkusTest` | `quarkus-junit5-mockito` provides `@InjectMock` — replaces a CDI bean with a Mockito mock for the test class. Use for collaborator beans (e.g. `CaseMemoryStore`) when you need to control return values or verify interactions. Do NOT use `mockStatic` for Panache Active Record entities — static methods are inherited from `PanacheEntityBase` and Mockito cannot intercept them (GE-20260629-74fc65). See `ExternalActorServiceTest`. |
| Multi-PU entity package placement | Ledger subclass entities must NOT be sub-packages of `io.casehub.life.app.entity` (default PU). Use `io.casehub.life.app.ledger` — Quarkus uses prefix matching for PU assignment; sub-packages of a default-PU package get assigned to the default PU, causing cross-PU association errors with `LedgerEntry.supplements`. |
| Testing engine case definitions | Definition tests (verify YAML loads, binding count, goal count, capabilities) are pure unit tests — no Quarkus startup needed. Integration tests (start case → workers execute → goals met) require @QuarkusTest. Use `CaseIntegrationTestSupport` helpers: `startCase`, `awaitWorker`, `completeHumanTask`, `awaitCaseCompleted`. Pattern: `QuarkusTransaction.requiringNew()` for Panache queries inside Awaitility lambdas; filter WorkItems by `callerRef` prefix to avoid cross-test interference. Pure humanTask cases (e.g. family-vote) skip `startCase` — no workers to await. |
| Testing attestation pipeline (unit) | Mock `LedgerEntryRepository` with Mockito. Verify verdicts (SOUND/FLAGGED), capability tags, dimension scores. Guard: CREATED events produce no attestation. See `LifeOutcomeAttestationWriterTest`. |
| Trust routing policy provider | `@QuarkusTest` — inject `TrustRoutingPolicyProvider`, verify capability→domain resolution, YAML blend factors and quality floors. See `LifeTrustRoutingPolicyProviderTest`. |
| Testing `ActionRiskClassifier` | Unit tests: mock `PreferenceProvider`, use `lenient().when(...)` in `@BeforeEach` for shared stubs — NEVER/unknown types skip `resolve()` entirely, triggering `UnnecessaryStubbingException` in strict mode. `@QuarkusTest`: inject `@RiskClassifier Instance<ActionRiskClassifier>` to verify CDI qualifier wiring. See `LifeActionRiskClassifierTest`, `LifeActionRiskClassifierQuarkusTest`. |
| Testing visibility policies in `@QuarkusTest` | `@TestSecurity` only sets `SecurityIdentity` for `@RolesAllowed`; does NOT populate `CurrentPrincipal.groups()`. Inject `FixedCurrentPrincipal`, call `setGroups()` in `@BeforeEach`, `reset()` in `@AfterEach`. Without this, visibility filters silently return empty results (HTTP 200, items.size()=0). See GE-20260719-4e2784. |
| Testing `HumanTaskTarget.candidateGroups()` | Returns sealed `ListEvaluator`. Pattern: `ht.candidateGroups() instanceof ListEvaluator.StaticList sl && sl.values().contains("group-name")`. Import `io.casehub.api.model.evaluator.ListEvaluator`. |
| Engine CDI wiring | `quarkus.arc.selected-alternatives` must include `InMemorySubCaseGroupRepository`, `InMemoryPlanItemStore`, `InMemoryReactivePlanItemStore`, `InMemoryReactiveEventLogRepository`, `InMemoryReactiveCaseInstanceRepository`, `InMemoryReactiveSubCaseGroupRepository`, `InMemoryReactiveCaseMetaModelRepository` from casehub-engine-persistence-memory. |
| Testing LLM-backed workers (6 LifeTypedCaseHubs + CareEpisodeCaseHub) | Use `@Alternative @Priority(10) @ApplicationScoped` test CDI bean `TestLifeOpenClawChatModelFactory` registered in `quarkus.arc.selected-alternatives` in test config. **Never use `@InjectMock`** for beans used in `configureCase()` or `augment()` — Mockito's CDI proxy reset between test classes triggers a Quarkus restart, re-registering Vert.x codecs and failing ALL subsequent `@QuarkusTest` classes. The test factory matches on system prompt key phrases (not user message text) to serve correct canned responses for all 32 workers. **Canned response values must match old stub behavioral intent** — e.g. `requiresApproval: true` when the old stub computed `totalCost > 2000`. See `TestLifeOpenClawChatModelFactory`, GE-20260626-0e976f. |
| Engine-ledger PU packages | `io.casehub.ledger.model` must be in the qhorus PU packages — this is `casehub-engine-ledger`'s entity package (e.g. `WorkerDecisionEntry`, `CaseLedgerEntry`), distinct from `io.casehub.ledger.runtime` (casehub-ledger base). Without it: `Unknown entity type 'WorkerDecisionEntry' does not belong to this persistence unit`. |
| SubCase M-of-N in YAML | M-of-N fields (groupId, totalInGroup, requiredCount) are DSL-only — not YAML-supported. Add via Java augmentation in `configureCase()` (LifeTypedCaseHub subclasses) or `augment()` (YamlCaseHub subclasses). `getDefinition()` is final — never override it (GE-20260531-d896bf). |

## What This Project Owns

### Domain Model

**Life domain entities:**
- `LifeDomain` enum — `HOUSEHOLD`, `HEALTH`, `FINANCE`, `FAMILY_SCHEDULING`, `TRAVEL`, `LEGAL`, `CONTRACTOR_COORDINATION`, `ELDER_CARE`
- `ExternalActor` — contractor, doctor, service provider, or institution: `{name, actorType, contactMethod, contactValue, gdprErasedAt}` — the one genuine JPA domain entity
- `LifeTaskContext` — domain supplement for foundation WorkItems: `{workItemId, domain, externalActorId, recurrence, jurisdiction}` — carries life-specific context that has no foundation home. `jurisdiction` is optional (ISO 3166-1/2, e.g. "GB", "US-CA"); `LegalDomainLedgerHandler` prefers it over tenant-wide config default.

Note: `HouseholdTask`, `LifeGoal`, `LifeEvent` were removed in Layer 2 — they duplicated foundation primitives (WorkItem, CaseInstance, LedgerEntry). See `docs/specs/2026-05-27-layer2-casehub-work-sla.md` and parent#79.

**Layer 3 additions:**
- `LifeCommitmentRecord` — supplement to qhorus native `Commitment`, keyed by `correlationId`; tracks DELEGATION/CONTRACTOR/OVERSIGHT commitment mode and status. Fields: `domain` (LifeDomain — populated at creation, replaces hardcoded FINANCE), `oversightKey` (OVERSIGHT dedup key, resolves delegateTo semantic overload). `workItemId` is null for OVERSIGHT until household-admin RESPONSE fulfills the gate.
- `LifeCommitmentStrategy` — internal app/ SPI (not api/ — context types reference JPA entities); three implementations: `DelegationCommitmentStrategy`, `ContractorCommitmentStrategy`, `OversightGateStrategy`.
- Channel topology: `life/delegation` (shared, family delegation), `life/oversight` (shared, COMMAND+RESPONSE only), `life/actor/{externalActorId}` (per-actor, contractor commitments). One APPROVAL_PENDING Watchdog per channel.

**Layer 4 additions:**
- `HealthDecisionLedgerEntry`, `FinancialDecisionLedgerEntry`, `LegalActionLedgerEntry`, `ExternalActorErasureLedgerEntry` — four JOINED-inheritance `LedgerEntry` subclasses in `io.casehub.life.app.ledger` (qhorus PU). Per-domain required fields; `@DiscriminatorValue` discriminates.
- `LifeDecisionEventType` — enum: `CREATED`, `SLA_BREACH`, `COMPLETED`. Internal to `app/`.
- `LifeLedgerWriter` — unified writer service; owns `sequenceNumber` computation and base field assembly. `@PrePersist` on `LedgerEntry` handles `id` and `occurredAt`.
- `LifeDecisionLedgerObserver` — CDI observer for `SlaBreachEvent` (HEALTH/LEGAL/FINANCE SLA_BREACH) and `WorkItemLifecycleEvent` (COMPLETED only). `@Transactional(REQUIRES_NEW)`.
- GDPR Art.17 erasure: `DELETE /external-actors/{id}/personal-data` — nullifies PII, calls `CaseMemoryStore.eraseEntity()` (guarded by `MemoryCapabilityException` catch → 0), writes `ExternalActorErasureLedgerEntry` with `memoryRecordsErased` count. `erasedBy` from `CurrentPrincipal.actorId()`. Guards: 404/409 already-erased/409 active-tasks.
- actorId convention: `"life-system"` for system events; GDPR erasure actorId comes from `currentPrincipal.actorId()` (auth wired: life#40). Erasure endpoint returns 200 with `ErasureResponse(erasedActorId, erasedAt, memoryRecordsErased, ledgerEntriesAffected, tokenisationEnabled)`.
- `LifeGdprErasureService` — dedicated erasure pipeline: PII nullification → memory erasure → `LedgerErasureService.erase()` tokenisation → `ExternalActorErasureLedgerEntry` write. Replaces inline `ExternalActorService.erase()`.
- `ExternalActorErasureLedgerEntry` — gained `ledgerEntriesAffected` (long) for self-contained erasure proof in Merkle chain.

**Layer 5 additions:**
- `LifeCaseTracker` — JPA entity tracking active engine cases by type for cross-case signal lookup: `{id, caseType, engineCaseId, status, createdAt, completedAt}`. Default datasource.
- `LifeCaseType` enum in `api/`: TRAVEL_PLAN, HOME_MAINTENANCE, CARE_COORDINATION, APPOINTMENT_CYCLE, CONTRACTOR_COORDINATION, FINANCIAL_REVIEW. FAMILY_VOTE is not a LifeCaseType — spawned only as sub-case.
- `LifeCaseStatus` enum in `api/`: ACTIVE, COMPLETED, FAILED.
- `LifeCaseService` — three-phase case start (PP-20260529-3ffe28). Direct injection of each YamlCaseHub, switch on LifeCaseType.
- `LifeCaseTrackerObserver` — `@ObservesAsync CaseLifecycleEvent` updates tracker status.
- `LifeDecisionLedgerObserver` — refactored: domain resolution now uses `WorkItem.scope` Path (primary), LifeTaskContext (fallback).
- `LifeTypedCaseHub` — abstract base in `io.casehub.life.app.engine` extending `YamlCaseHub`; template method `augment()` (final) calls `configureCase()` (abstract) then registers agent descriptors. `agentWorker(capabilityName, systemPrompt, responseSchema)` helper builds Agent→Worker→AgentWorkerFunction. `lifeCaseType()` abstract method carries case-type identity. 6 subclasses extend it; CareEpisodeCaseHub extends YamlCaseHub directly (sub-case only, no LifeCaseType); FamilyVoteCaseHub extends YamlCaseHub (no augmentation). 8 YAML case definitions at `app/src/main/resources/life/`.
- 8 YAML case definitions at `app/src/main/resources/life/`.
- `POST /life-cases` endpoint — `LifeCaseResource`.
- Scope retrofit: WorkItem scope changed from `"life"` to `"casehubio/life/{domain}"` (hierarchical Path format).

**Layer 6 additions:**
- `LifeActorIds` — `api/` utility for `life-actor:{uuid}` actorId convention mapping ExternalActor UUIDs to ledger actorIds.
- `LifeOutcomeAttestationWriter` — attestation pipeline: converts WorkItem outcomes and SLA breaches into `LedgerAttestation` records with verdict (SOUND/FLAGGED), capability tag (domain-derived), and `deadline-reliability` dimension score.
- `LifeTrustRoutingPolicyProvider` — `TrustRoutingPolicyProvider` SPI implementation with 32-entry fine-grained capability→domain mapping and 8 domain routing policies (threshold, minObservations, borderlineMargin, fallbackType, rationale).
- `LifeTrustRoutingPolicyKeys` — `PreferenceKey` constants for YAML trust routing config (blend-factor + 4 dimension floor keys).
- `DoublePreference` — `SingleValuePreference` record for YAML double values.
- `LifeRoutingPolicy` — domain routing policy record (code-level design decisions).
- `trust-routing.yaml` — YAML config at `casehub/life/trust-routing.yaml` for blend factors and quality floors per domain.
- `TrustProfile` — nested record on `ExternalActorResponse` enriched from `TrustGateService` (globalScore, dimensionScores, capabilityScores).
- ActorId convention: `life-actor:{uuid}` for ExternalActor behaviour in ledger entries; `"life-system"` for system actions.

**Layer 7 additions (partial — AgentExec wiring, life#25):**
- `LifeOpenClawChatModelFactory` — `app/engine/agent/` `@ApplicationScoped`; `forAgent(LifeAgent)`
  creates a per-agent `ChatModelProvider` backed by `OpenClawAgentProvider` → `DirectCallBridge` →
  `/hooks/agent` (webhook delivery). Config: standard `casehub.openclaw.*` keys from
  `OpenClawClientConfig` (`casehub-openclaw-core`). Each `forAgent()` call creates a `ChatModel` once
  during `configureCase()` (caching handled by `YamlCaseHub.getDefinition()`, once per JVM lifetime). Config changes require restart.
- `LifeAgent` — `app/engine/` enum: 4 agent identity constants (HEALTH, HOME, FINANCE, TRAVEL).
  `agentId()` derives `{MODEL_FAMILY}:{persona}@{MAJOR_VERSION}`. `persona()` returns the bare
  persona for `LifeOpenClawChatModelFactory`. Separate from `LifeDomain` — mapping is not 1:1.
- `LifeAgentDescriptorFactory` — `app/engine/agent/` `@ApplicationScoped`; constructor-injected
  `tenancyId` + `jurisdiction` (new config, default "GB"). `descriptorFor(LifeAgent)` builds
  `AgentDescriptor` via builder. Eliminates 7 per-CaseHub descriptor methods and config injections.
- 32 response schema records — `app/engine/agent/` Java records; structured output schemas for all workers.
  `AgentBuilder.responseSchema(Record.class)` derives the JSON schema. `OpenClawChatModel.doChat()`
  auto-extracts the schema and serialises it into the message sent to `/hooks/agent`.
- `TestLifeOpenClawChatModelFactory` (src/test only) — `@Alternative @Priority(10) @ApplicationScoped`;
  returns canned JSON responses keyed by system prompt content. Registered via
  `quarkus.arc.selected-alternatives`. Avoids `@InjectMock` (CDI restart issue).
- `casehub.life.tenancy-id` — required config property (no default); must be set in deployment environment
  (absent from production `application.properties`; present in test config with canonical test UUID).
- `casehub-openclaw-core` + `casehub-openclaw-casehub` — dependencies for OpenClaw direct-call bridge.
  **CDI exclusions required:** 11 heartbeat-mode beans from casehub-openclaw-casehub must be excluded
  via `quarkus.arc.exclude-types` — see PP-20260618-openclaw-agent and GE-20260626-a37306.
- AgentDescriptor convention: `{model-family}:{persona}@{major}` per `docs/specs/life-actor-model.md`.
  Example: `"openclaw:health-agent@1"`. Must match casehub-openclaw-casehub config map key when
  WorkerProvisioner is wired (life#37).

**Layer 7 additions (partial — risk classification):**
- `HouseholdActionType` — `api/` enum: 11 action types, `GatePolicy` (ALWAYS/AMOUNT_THRESHOLD/NEVER),
  `ThresholdCategory` (SPEND/BOOKING/CONTRACTOR), `reversible`, `candidateGroups`.
  `actionType()` / `fromActionType()` provide type-safe `PlannedAction` construction.
- `HouseholdGroups` — `api/` string constants: `household-admin`, `household-member`, `household-junior`.
- `LifeRiskPolicyKeys` — `app/routing/` `PreferenceKey` constants. Namespace: `casehubio.life.risk-policy`.
  Member thresholds: spend.threshold (100.0), contractor.threshold (200.0), booking.threshold (150.0), approval.expires-hours (24.0).
  Admin elevated thresholds: admin.spend.threshold (500.0), admin.contractor.threshold (500.0), admin.booking.threshold (300.0).
- `LifeActionRiskClassifier` — `app/routing/` `@ApplicationScoped @RiskClassifier`; implements
  `ActionRiskClassifier` from casehub-engine-api. Discovered by engine's `ChainedReactiveActionRiskClassifier`
  via `@Inject @RiskClassifier Instance<ActionRiskClassifier>`. Injects `CurrentPrincipal` (RBAC tier selection):
  admin → elevated thresholds; junior (negative: !admin && !member) → always GateRequired on AMOUNT_THRESHOLD;
  context-inactive (async worker, ContextNotActiveException) → member threshold fallback.
- `risk-policy.yaml` — YAML config at `casehub/life/risk-policy.yaml`; single scope `casehubio/life/risk-policy`.
  Contains both member and admin tier thresholds.
- scope convention: `"casehubio/life/oversight"` — verify against engine#437 once engine docs clarify scope→channel mapping.

**Layer 7 additions (full — WorkerProvisioner heartbeat, life#37):**
- `LifeSentinelRegistry` — `app/engine/` `@ApplicationScoped`; tracks provisioned sentinels
  by (caseId, capabilityName). CopyOnWriteArrayList per case. Supports concurrent same-agent
  cases (no 1:1 constraint). `isProvisioned()` provides idempotency guard for the provisioner.
- `LifeReactiveWorkerProvisioner` — `app/engine/` `@ApplicationScoped`; implements
  `ReactiveWorkerProvisioner`. Idempotent via `LifeSentinelRegistry`. Resolves `LifeAgent`
  from `LifeSentinelConfig`. Schedules Quartz `LifeHeartbeatJob` per sentinel. Displaces
  `NoOpReactiveWorkerProvisioner` (`@DefaultBean`).
- `LifeHeartbeatJob` — `app/engine/` `@ApplicationScoped` Quartz job. Each tick:
  `CaseHubRuntime.query()` → `Agent.execute()` → `CaseHubRuntime.signal("sentinelReport")`.
  Per-sentinel response schemas (7 records in `app/engine/agent/`).
- `LifeProvisionerCleanupObserver` — `app/engine/` `@ApplicationScoped`; observes
  `CaseLifecycleEvent` for terminal states (CaseCompleted, CaseFaulted, CaseCancelled).
  Calls `provisioner.terminateAllForCase()`.
- `LifeSentinelConfig` — `app/engine/` `@ConfigMapping(prefix="casehub.life.sentinel")`;
  maps capability name → LifeAgent + heartbeat interval.
- 7 sentinel response schemas — `app/engine/agent/` records: ContractorSentinelReport,
  MaintenanceSentinelReport, FollowUpSentinelReport, CareQualitySentinelReport,
  PatientStatusSentinelReport, AnomalySentinelReport, BookingSentinelReport.

**Layer 8 additions (CBR — Case-Based Reasoning, life#52):**
- `LifeCaseOutcomeCbrWriter` — `app/cbr/` `@ApplicationScoped` implements `CaseOutcomeObserver`;
  per-case retention: on terminal state, extracts features via CbrConfig JQ expressions,
  writes `PlanCbrCase` to `CbrCaseMemoryStore`. Interim `tenantId = "life-personal"` until
  engine adds tenantId to `CaseOutcomeEvent`.
- `LifeRoutingOutcomeRecorder` — `app/cbr/` `@ApplicationScoped` implements `RoutingOutcomeRecorder`;
  per-routing-decision retention: per worker execution, resolves case type via `CaseTypeLookup`,
  extracts features via CbrConfig JQ, writes `PlanCbrCase` with `PlanTrace`. Reactive pipeline.
- `LifeCbrFeatureSchemaRegistrar` — `app/cbr/` `@ApplicationScoped` `@Observes StartupEvent`;
  registers 6 `CbrFeatureSchema` instances with `CbrCaseMemoryStore`. SimilaritySpecs:
  `CategoricalTable` for season/severity, `GaussianDecay` for cost/time fields.
- `LifeCbrDescriptionProvider` — `app/cbr/` internal SPI; 6 implementations in `app/cbr/describe/`.
  `caseType()`, `describeProblem()`, `describeSolution()`, `extractEntityId()`.
- `spec.cbr` on 6 YAML case definitions — JQ feature extractors, weights, domain, timing=case-lifetime.
  Domains: `casehubio/life/{contractor,household,health,eldercare,finance,travel}`.
- `casehub-neocortex-memory-api` + `casehub-neocortex-memory-cbr-inmem` (test) — Maven dependencies.
  `InMemoryCbrCaseMemoryStore` (`@Alternative @Priority(2)`) in tests; `NoOpCbrCaseMemoryStore`
  (`@DefaultBean`) in production until Qdrant is configured.
- Engine dependencies: ~~engine#505~~ CLOSED, ~~engine#683~~ CLOSED, ~~engine#707~~ CLOSED.
  Routing consumes CBR experiences; experiences flow to worker execution.
- `LifeCbrFeatureExtractor` — `app/cbr/` `@ApplicationScoped`; shared feature extraction
  pipeline consolidating registry lookup → CbrConfig → JQ evaluation → FeatureValue map.
  Used by retention writers and suggestion service.
- `LifeCbrSuggestionService` — `app/cbr/` `@ApplicationScoped`; queries `CbrCaseMemoryStore`
  at case start, computes `FeatureStatistics` (nearest-rank percentiles) per numeric feature,
  returns `CbrSuggestions` with `historicalSuccessRate` and `averageSimilarity`.
- `CbrSuggestions` + `FeatureStatistics` — `api/` records for structured calibration data.
- `LifeCbrExperienceFormatter` — `app/cbr/` `@ApplicationScoped`; formats
  `List<RetrievedExperience>` into structured prompt text for LLM consumption.
- `CbrInputTransformer` — `app/cbr/` `UnaryOperator<JsonNode>`; reads
  `WorkerExecutionContext.current().experiences()` at execution time, merges `_cbrContext`
  into the Agent input. Registered on every Agent via `LifeTypedCaseHub.agentWorker()`.
- `LifeCaseService.startCase()` — calls `retrieveForAdaptation()` between Phase 1 and Phase 2,
  writes `cbrCalibration` (≥2 cases) and `adaptedPlan` (≥1 case) to initial case context.
  Fires `CbrAdaptationRecorded` CDI event with `AdaptationTrace` after adaptation.
- `LifeAdaptationRule` — `app/cbr/` internal SPI; 6 implementations in `app/cbr/adapt/`.
  `caseType()`, `knownCapabilities()`, `adapt(ScoredCbrCase, Map<String, FeatureValue>)`.
  Pure functions — no injected dependencies.
- `LifePlanAdapter` — `app/cbr/` `@Alternative @Priority(10)` implements `PlanAdapter`
  (neocortex SPI); dispatches to per-domain `LifeAdaptationRule` by caseType. Dual method
  surface: SPI (infers caseType from capabilities) + life-internal (explicit caseType).
  Displaces `NoOpPlanAdapter` (`@DefaultBean`).
- `SeverityScaling` — `app/cbr/adapt/` static helper; shared severity-to-priority
  scaling between `HealthAdaptationRule` and `AppointmentCycleAdaptationRule`.
- `LifeCbrRetrievalResult` — `app/cbr/` record; carries `CbrSuggestions` + raw
  `List<ScoredCbrCase<PlanCbrCase>>` + `Map<String, FeatureValue>` from retrieval.
  Keeps neocortex types out of `api/`.
- `LifeCbrSuggestionService.retrieveForAdaptation()` — retrieves cases with ≥1 threshold
  (adaptation) vs ≥2 (statistics). Returns `LifeCbrRetrievalResult`.
- `LifeCbrExperienceFormatter.formatAdaptedPlan()` — formats `AdaptedPlan` steps into
  structured text for LLM consumption (capability, action, priority, reason, parameters).
- `CbrInputTransformer` — enhanced: reads `adaptedPlan` from input JsonNode, deserializes,
  formats via `formatAdaptedPlan()`, appends to `_cbrContext` alongside raw experiences.
- 6 domain adaptation rules: `ContractorAdaptationRule` (season/budget/failed/trust),
  `HomeMaintenanceAdaptationRule` (seasonal SLA/cost/failed/trust),
  `HealthAdaptationRule` (severity/provider/SLA breach/trust/factual-accuracy),
  `AppointmentCycleAdaptationRule` (severity/provider/prep-time/trust),
  `FinancialAdaptationRule` (amount/escalation pattern),
  `TravelPlanAdaptationRule` (budget/seasonal pricing/rejected booking).
- `LifeTrustFeatureEnricher` — `app/cbr/` `@ApplicationScoped`; enriches CBR feature
  map with trust scores from `TrustGateService` when `externalActorId` is in context.
  Adds `actorTrustScore`, `actorDeadlineReliability`, `actorCostAccuracy`,
  `actorFactualAccuracy`, `actorProactiveAlerting` as `FeatureValue.NumberVal` entries.
  Only adds features when `OptionalDouble` scores are present.
  Called by `LifeCaseService.startCase()` between retrieval and adaptation.
- Trust-aware adaptation: 4 rules (Contractor, Health, AppointmentCycle, HomeMaintenance)
  check enriched trust features. Low global trust (< 0.3) flags steps with
  "consider alternative" reason. Low dimension scores (< 0.5) BOOST monitoring
  capabilities (watchdog-escalation, maintenance-sentinel, health-check).
  FinancialAdaptationRule and TravelPlanAdaptationRule do not involve external actors.
- Engine dependency: engine#738 (PlanAdapter wiring into CbrRetrievalService) — OPEN.
  Until wired, life calls PlanAdapter directly from LifeCaseService.
- 8 workers gain domain-specific CBR calibration instructions in system prompts.
- 8 YAML capabilities gain `cbrCalibration` in `inputProjection`.

**Capability tags:**
- `household-management` — routine household coordination: grocery ordering, maintenance scheduling, contractor liaison
- `health-coordination` — appointment booking, medication reminders, follow-up tracking, GP escalation
- `financial-planning` — budget review, purchase research, decision gate for major expenditure
- `family-scheduling` — shared family calendar, obligation distribution, delegation tracking
- `travel-planning` — trip research, itinerary coordination, booking confirmations
- `legal-deadline` — tax filing deadlines, contract renewals, compliance obligations
- `contractor-coordination` — quote tracking, job completion follow-up, payment approval gates
- `elder-care` — care scheduling, health monitoring, family delegation for dependent care

**Trust dimensions:**
- `deadline-reliability` — track record of meeting committed deadlines (contractors, service providers)
- `cost-accuracy` — accuracy of quoted vs actual costs (financial agents, contractor quotes)
- `factual-accuracy` — reliability of information retrieval (health advice agents, legal deadline agents)
- `proactive-alerting` — track record of surfacing risks before they become crises

### CasePlanModels

- `appointment-cycle` — book appointment, confirm, send pre-visit prep, follow-up after, record outcome
- `home-maintenance-cycle` — schedule inspection, get quotes, approve contractor, monitor job, verify completion
- `financial-review` — monthly budget review, flag anomalies, escalate major decisions to oversight channel
- `travel-plan` — research options, approval gate for bookings above threshold, confirm itinerary
- `contractor-coordination` — issue COMMAND for quote by date, Watchdog follow-up if no ETA, payment gate on completion
- `care-coordination` — recurring care schedule, health status monitoring, family delegation for availability

### Permission Topology

- `household-admin` — full authority: approve major financial decisions, delegate tasks, configure SLAs
- `household-member` — standard member: view all, action assigned tasks, request new tasks
- `household-junior` — restricted: view own tasks only, cannot approve financial decisions

M-of-N quorum configuration for shared household decisions (e.g. 2-of-3 adults required for purchases above threshold).

## Module Structure

```
api/    — pure Java: LifeDomain enum, ExternalActor request/response records,
          CreateLifeTaskRequest, LifeTaskResponse, CommitmentMode/CommitmentStatus/
          CommitmentOutcome/CommitmentRequest/OversightGateRequest (Layer 3),
          LifeActorIds (Layer 6), capability tag constants, trust dimension constants.
          PagedResponse<T> (generic pagination), Urgency enum (deadline classification),
          PendingActionResponse, CaseStatisticsResponse, SlaComplianceResponse,
          TrustAnalyticsResponse, TrustHistoryEntry, ActorActivityEntry.
          Zero framework imports. No JPA.

app/    — Quarkus: JPA entities (ExternalActor, LifeTaskContext, LifeCommitmentRecord,
          LifeCaseTracker), REST resources, Flyway migrations (db/life/migration/, V100–V111),
          service layer (LifeGdprErasureService — GDPR erasure pipeline), SPI implementations (LifeSlaBreachPolicy, LifeCommitmentStrategy + 3 impls),
          infrastructure (LifeChannelInitializer), observers (LifeOversightResponseObserver,
          LifeWatchdogAlertObserver, LifeDecisionLedgerObserver, LifeCaseTrackerObserver),
          engine (io.casehub.life.app.engine — LifeTypedCaseHub abstract base + 6 subclasses + CareEpisodeCaseHub (YamlCaseHub) + FamilyVoteCaseHub (YamlCaseHub) +
          LifeCaseService + LifeCaseTrackerObserver),
          routing (io.casehub.life.app.routing — LifeTrustRoutingPolicyProvider +
          LifeTrustRoutingPolicyKeys + LifeRoutingPolicy + DoublePreference),
          CasePlanModel YAML definitions (app/src/main/resources/life/),
          trust routing YAML config (app/src/main/resources/casehub/life/trust-routing.yaml).
          Ledger subclasses in io.casehub.life.app.ledger (qhorus PU);
          ledger join table migrations at db/life/ledger/migration/ (V2100+).
          cbr (io.casehub.life.app.cbr — LifeCaseOutcomeCbrWriter, LifeRoutingOutcomeRecorder,
          LifeCbrFeatureSchemaRegistrar, LifeCbrDescriptionProvider + 6 impls in cbr/describe/).
          read-side API (io.casehub.life.app.service — ExternalActorHistoryService,
          PendingActionsService, LifeAnalyticsService, LifeCaseQueryService;
          io.casehub.life.app.resource — PendingActionsResource, LifeAnalyticsResource).
          event (io.casehub.life.app.event — LifeEventBroadcaster, LifeEventBridge,
          LifeEventSseResource; SSE CDI→broadcaster→stream bridge for real-time UI updates).

life-ui/ — Lit 3.x SPA served via Quarkus Quinoa (quarkus-quinoa 2.8.3).
           Vite build with aliases to sibling @casehubio/blocks-ui-* and
           @casehubio/pages-* repos (not npm-published yet).
           app-shell (hash routing), home-view (KPI dashboard), inbox-view
           (work-item-workbench composition). Quinoa enabled only in dev/demo
           profiles (disabled default + tests). Start with:
           JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 26) mvn quarkus:dev -pl app -Dquarkus.profile=demo

## Foundation Layers

Each layer corresponds to a foundation module integration step. `ARC42STORIES.MD §9.4` tracks completion — a layer is not done until its entry is written. `LAYER-LOG.md` is the source-of-truth draft.

```
Layer 1: Domain baseline — ExternalActor entity, REST API, life domain vocabulary (LifeDomain,
         LifeCapabilities, LifeTrustDimensions). No foundation modules active.
         Note: HouseholdTask/LifeGoal/LifeEvent entities introduced here were removed in
         Layer 2 (duplicated foundation primitives — parent#79).
         ✅ COMPLETE

Layer 2: + casehub-work — SLA enforcement via WorkItemTemplate + LifeTaskContext supplement.
         POST /life-tasks creates WorkItem + LifeTaskContext atomically. LifeSlaBreachPolicy
         enforces stateless two-tier escalation. Flyway at db/life/migration/.
         Note: casehub-engine deps removed until SNAPSHOT is fixed (engine#379, engine#380).
         ✅ COMPLETE

Layer 3: + casehub-qhorus — commitment lifecycle: family delegation (COMMAND to household-member),
         contractor follow-up (COMMAND + Watchdog), oversight gates for major financial decisions
         (COMMAND to household-admin; no action until RESPONSE received).
         ✅ COMPLETE

Layer 4: + casehub-ledger — tamper-evident Merkle audit for health decisions, financial
         decisions, and legal actions. GDPR Art.17 erasure for contractor personal data.
         ✅ COMPLETE

Layer 5: + casehub-engine — 8 CasePlanModel workflows (travel-plan, home-maintenance,
         care-coordination, appointment-cycle, contractor-coordination, financial-review,
         family-vote, care-episode). Parallel execution, adaptive gates, M-of-N SubCase
         quorum, QhorusMessageSignalBridge, cross-case signals, milestones, FuncDSL workers.
         Integration tests re-enabled (engine#410 resolved — commit 66a6e34).
         ✅ COMPLETE

Layer 6: Trust routing — TrustRoutingPolicyProvider with 8 domain policies +
         32-entry capability→domain mapping. Attestation pipeline (LifeOutcomeAttestationWriter)
         converts outcomes to LedgerAttestation records. ExternalActor REST response enriched
         with ledger-backed TrustProfile. casehub-engine-ledger activates TrustWeightedAgentStrategy.
         casehub-platform-config provides YAML PreferenceProvider.
         Single-candidate limitation: FuncDSL workers = trivial routing decisions until Layer 7.
         ✅ COMPLETE

Layer 7 (partial): Action risk classification — LifeActionRiskClassifier intercepts
         consequential worker actions before execution. @RiskClassifier CDI qualifier
         activates via ChainedReactiveActionRiskClassifier. HouseholdActionType enum
         (api/) owns the full action taxonomy: 11 types across 3 gate policies
         (ALWAYS / AMOUNT_THRESHOLD / NEVER). YAML thresholds in risk-policy.yaml
         via casehub-platform-config. RBAC-differentiated thresholds: admin elevated
         (spend/contractor/booking), junior always-gates on AMOUNT_THRESHOLD, context-inactive
         falls back to member threshold (life#26). Full Layer 7 = + casehub-openclaw as WorkerProvisioner.
         ✅ COMPLETE (risk classification + RBAC thresholds)  🔲 PENDING (OpenClaw integration)

Layer 7 (partial — AgentExec wiring): First real LLM-backed worker (life#25). Establishes
         AgentWorkerFunction + LifeOpenClawChatModelFactory for OpenClaw /hooks/agent direct-call.
         All 32 workers across 7 YamlCaseHubs converted from stubs to AgentExec via
         `OpenClawAgentProvider` → `DirectCallBridge` → `/hooks/agent` (webhook delivery).
         4 OpenClaw agents: health-agent, home-agent, finance-agent, travel-agent.
         32 response schema records enforce structured output via prompt-level schema injection.
         AgentDescriptor registered on CaseDefinition (engine#543) per {model-family}:{persona}@{major}.
         Protocol: docs/protocols/casehub-life/openclaw-agent-worker-pattern.md.
         ✅ COMPLETE (direct-call + all workers)  🔲 PENDING (WorkerProvisioner heartbeat — life#37)

Layer 7 (full): + casehub-openclaw — OpenClaw as WorkerProvisioner; skill ecosystem (banking APIs,
         calendar integration, Home Assistant, messaging).
         LifeReactiveWorkerProvisioner implements ReactiveWorkerProvisioner SPI.
         7 sentinel capabilities across all case plans. LifeSentinelRegistry tracks
         provisioned sentinels (supports concurrent same-agent cases). LifeHeartbeatJob
         (Quartz) invokes Agent.execute() periodically, signals results via
         CaseHubRuntime.signal(). LifeProvisionerCleanupObserver handles termination.
         LifeSentinelConfig maps capabilities to LifeAgent + heartbeat interval.
         LifeChannelContextProvider (life#61) enriches heartbeat agents with recent
         qhorus channel messages (delegation, oversight, per-actor) before execution.
         Config: `casehub.life.channel-context.message-limit` (default 10).
         Skill integration (#60) blocked on casehub-openclaw Epic 4.
         ✅ COMPLETE (wiring + channel context)  🔲 PENDING (skill integration — #60)

Layer 8: + casehub-neocortex (CBR) — Case-Based Reasoning for adaptive life automation.
         Per-case retention via CaseOutcomeObserver (LifeCaseOutcomeCbrWriter), per-routing-decision
         retention via RoutingOutcomeRecorder (LifeRoutingOutcomeRecorder). 6 domain feature schemas
         with CategoricalTable and GaussianDecay SimilaritySpecs (LifeCbrFeatureSchemaRegistrar).
         YAML spec.cbr on all 6 eligible case definitions with JQ feature extractors.
         LifeCbrDescriptionProvider (6 impls) for domain problem/solution/entityId extraction.
         Engine dependencies: ~~engine#505~~ CLOSED, ~~engine#683~~ CLOSED, ~~engine#707~~ CLOSED.
         CBR engine integration (#56): LifeCbrFeatureExtractor consolidates feature extraction.
         LifeCbrSuggestionService queries CBR store at case start, writes cbrCalibration to context.
         LifeCbrExperienceFormatter + CbrInputTransformer enrich every Agent with _cbrContext
         via inputTransformer. 8 workers gain calibration instructions, 8 YAML inputProjections
         gain cbrCalibration. CbrSuggestions/FeatureStatistics in api/.
         CBR adaptation (#55): LifePlanAdapter implements PlanAdapter SPI with 6 per-domain
         LifeAdaptationRule implementations (contractor, home-maintenance, health, appointment,
         financial, travel). Composite dispatch by caseType. SeverityScaling shared helper.
         LifeCbrRetrievalResult + retrieveForAdaptation() (≥1 case threshold for adaptation,
         ≥2 for statistics). AdaptedPlan written to case context; CbrInputTransformer enhanced
         to format adapted plan alongside raw experiences. AdaptationTrace fired as CDI event.
         Engine dependency: engine#738 (PlanAdapter wiring into CbrRetrievalService) — OPEN.
         Trust-score-aware adaptation (#67): LifeTrustFeatureEnricher queries TrustGateService
         for actors in context, enriches feature map before adapt(). 4 rules gain trust logic
         (Contractor, Health, AppointmentCycle, HomeMaintenance). FeatureStatistics upstream
         move tracked as neocortex#157.
         ✅ COMPLETE (retention + retrieval + integration + adaptation + trust-aware)  🔲 PENDING (#60 skill integration)
```

## Key Protocols

- **PP-20260524-a8f597** — casehub-platform scope rule: when to add `casehub-platform` and `casehub-platform-expression` as dependencies
- **PP-20260524-10efef** — Flyway ledger locations: add `classpath:db/ledger/migration` when casehub-ledger is active
- **PP-20260525-607b33** — Flyway repo-scoped path: life domain migrations at `db/life/migration/`
- **PP-20260527-da1f66** — domain supplement pattern: attach domain context to foundation primitives via supplement table, not wrapper entity
- **PP-20260526-d0b921** — REST resources must be `@Blocking @ApplicationScoped`; class-level `@Produces(APPLICATION_JSON)` and `@Consumes(APPLICATION_JSON)` required; creation endpoints return 201 Created (no Location header for resources without independent URIs)
- **PP-20260526-75d9c9** — `@Transactional` on service methods only, never resource methods
- **dual-trail-audit-pattern.md** — operational trail (casehub-work/qhorus) vs compliance ledger (casehub-ledger)
- **auth-retrofit-readiness.md** — auth wired (life#40): casehub-platform-oidc on classpath, @RolesAllowed on all REST resources; structural constraints (no auth in domain/service, thin resources, auth-free SPIs) remain active for future features
- **alternative-extension-patterns.md** — `@Alternative` CDI patterns for SPI wiring
- **PP-20260518-case-definition-layers** — YAML and fluent Java DSL are paired, equal authoring paths; every YAML must have a DSL companion
- **PP-20260531-worker-func-exec** (superseded for LLM workers by PP-20260618-openclaw-agent) —
  engine#463 settled: single LLM call → `Worker.builder().function(Agent.builder()...build())` (AgentExec);
  multi-step durable → `FuncWorkflowBuilder` or YAML workflow (Flow); stub / in-process → Sync lambda.
  FuncWorkflowBuilder is still correct for genuine multi-step workers with retry/branching.
  Raw `WorkerResult.of(map)` stubs remain for non-health workers until Layer 7 full lands.
- **PP-20260618-openclaw-agent** — WorkerFunction.AgentExec(Agent) + AgentDescriptor required for LLM-backed
  workers; agentId = {model-family}:{persona}@{major}; responseSchema required; config changes require restart.
  See docs/protocols/casehub-life/openclaw-agent-worker-pattern.md.
- **PP-20260529-3ffe28** — three-phase case start: never join() inside @Transactional

## Ecosystem Conventions

**Quarkus version:** All projects use `3.32.2`. When bumping, bump all projects together.

**GitHub Packages — dependency resolution:**
```xml
<repository>
  <id>github</id>
  <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/casehubio/*</url>
  <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
</repository>
```
CI must use `server-id: github` + `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `actions/setup-java`.

**Java on this machine:**
```bash
JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 26)
JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-25.jdk/Contents/Home  # native only
```

**Use `mvn` not `./mvnw`** — maven wrapper not configured on this machine.

**Demo profile:** `quarkus.profile=demo` activates standalone Household Hub mode. H2 in-memory, Flyway seeds at `db/life/demo/` (V9000+ range — avoids collision with domain V100+ and ledger V2100+), OIDC disabled. Start with: `JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 26) mvn quarkus:dev -pl app -Dquarkus.profile=demo`

**Multi-module test scoping:** Always scope Maven with `-pl <module> -am`. When combining `-am` with `-Dtest=ClassName`, add `-Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false`.

**Flyway critical rules:**
- Life domain migrations live at `db/life/migration/` (PP-20260525-607b33) — V100+
- Life ledger join table migrations at `db/life/ledger/migration/` — V2100+ (qhorus datasource)
- Production locations: `classpath:db/life/migration,classpath:db/work/migration`
- casehub-work occupies V1–V31; life starts at V100; ledger join tables at V2100+. V-ranges don't overlap.
- Add `classpath:db/ledger/migration` when casehub-ledger is active (PP-20260524-10efef)
- Add `classpath:db/qhorus/migration` when casehub-qhorus is active
- Qhorus PU packages must use `io.casehub.ledger.runtime` (broad) — NOT `io.casehub.ledger.runtime.model` (misses `LedgerSupplement` sub-package)

**CDI wiring:** `JpaLedgerEntryRepository` and `JpaActorTrustScoreRepository` are both `@Alternative`. The corresponding `@Default` beans (`NoOpLedgerEntryRepository`, `NoOpActorTrustScoreRepository`) are silent no-ops — omitting either JPA bean from `selected-alternatives` causes ledger writes and trust score reads to silently do nothing. Add both to `application.properties`:
```properties
quarkus.arc.selected-alternatives=\
  io.casehub.ledger.runtime.repository.jpa.JpaLedgerEntryRepository,\
  io.casehub.ledger.runtime.repository.jpa.JpaActorTrustScoreRepository
```

**SLA breach policy:** casehub-work resolves `SlaBreachPolicy` via `StrategyResolver` using config key `casehub.work.sla.breach-policy`. The default is `"no-op"` which silently disables all SLA escalation. casehub-life must set `casehub.work.sla.breach-policy=life-sla-breach` in both production and test `application.properties` to activate `LifeSlaBreachPolicy`. Without this, SLA breach escalation is completely silent — no warning, no error (GE-20260718-2fb8eb).

**CurrentPrincipal resolution (since platform#112):** `OidcCurrentPrincipal @Alternative @Priority(100)` wins in production; `FixedCurrentPrincipal @Alternative @Priority(200)` wins in tests (canonical tenancyId `278776f9-e1b0-46fb-9032-8bddebdcf9ce`). No `quarkus.arc.exclude-types` entries needed for CurrentPrincipal — CDI `@Alternative @Priority` handles disambiguation. Non-alternative beans (`TenantScopedPrincipal`, `QhorusInboundCurrentPrincipal`, `MockCurrentPrincipal`, `DefaultTestPrincipal`) are superseded automatically.

# Install api first — Quarkus generate-code scans api/target/classes before javac runs
JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 26) mvn --batch-mode install -pl api

# Then build app
JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 26) mvn --batch-mode install -pl app

# Full build
JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 26) mvn --batch-mode install

# Test a single class (app)
JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 26) mvn test -pl app -Dtest=ExternalActorResourceTest --batch-mode

# Compile only (no tests)
JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 26) mvn compile -pl api,app --batch-mode

# Frontend — build life-ui (Vite)
npm install --prefix life-ui
npm run build --prefix life-ui
```

**Important:** `mvn test -pl app` requires `api` to be installed in the local Maven repo first. Run `mvn install -pl api` if you get ClassNotFound errors for `io.casehub.life.api.*`.

**Frontend:** life-ui uses Vite aliases to resolve `@casehubio/blocks-ui-*` and `@casehubio/pages-*` from sibling repos (`../../blocks-ui/` and `../../pages/`). Both repos must be cloned and built (`yarn build` in blocks-ui) before the Vite build will succeed.

## Work Tracking

**Issue tracking:** enabled
**GitHub repo:** casehubio/life

**Automatic behaviours:**
- Before implementation begins — check for an active issue. If none, run issue-workflow Phase 1 before writing any code.
- Every issue must be linked to its parent epic — no orphan issues.
- Before any commit — confirm issue linkage.
- All commits reference an issue — `Refs #N` or `Closes #N`. No commit may be made without an issue reference.

## Development Workflow

### Platform Coherence
Before implementing any feature, SPI, data model, or abstraction — run the Platform Coherence Protocol in `../parent/docs/PLATFORM.md`. Check capability ownership, boundary rules, and consistency with existing patterns.

### TDD
Every implementation plan must include tests at all levels:
- **Unit tests** — pure domain logic in `api/` — records, interfaces, value types — standard JUnit 5, no Quarkus
- **Integration tests** (`@QuarkusTest` with H2) — JPA entities, REST resources, CDI wiring
- **Robustness tests** — boundary conditions, invalid input, missing data
- **Correctness tests** — SLA deadline computation, state machine transitions, quorum logic

Tests are part of the implementation plan from the start — not deferred.

### IntelliJ MCP Tools
Two IntelliJ MCPs are available: `mcp__intellij` and `mcp__intellij-index`.

**Always check both are available before starting implementation work.** If either is unavailable, stop and report before proceeding.

**Prefer IntelliJ tools over Bash** for all operations they support:

| Operation | Use IntelliJ tool, not Bash |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| Find a class, symbol, or file | `ide_find_class`, `ide_find_file`, `ide_search_text` |
| Navigate to a definition | `ide_find_definition` |
| Find all references before renaming/deleting | `ide_find_references` |
| Rename a symbol across the project | `ide_refactor_rename` |
| Move a file | `ide_move_file` |
| Check for errors in a file | `ide_diagnostics` |
| Build the project | `build_project` |
| Read a file by project-relative path | `get_file_text_by_path` |
| Search for text across files | `search_in_files_by_text` |

Only use Bash when the operation is outside IntelliJ's scope: git commands, Maven, file creation, shell scripts.

### Code Review
Before marking any task complete, invoke `superpowers:requesting-code-review` to review the implementation for quality, correctness, and platform consistency.

### Documentation Maintenance
After any code change, systematically check and update:

1. **This CLAUDE.md** — does any section describe something that no longer exists or no longer matches the code?
2. **`casehub-life.md`** in the parent repo — reflects the current state of domain ownership, epics, dependencies
3. **Cross-references** — any path or URL referenced in docs: verify it resolves, rename if the target moved
4. **Drift and gaps** — code that exists without doc coverage; docs that describe code that was removed or renamed
5. **ARC42STORIES.MD** — update §9.4 layer entry before closing any layer-related issue (LAYER-LOG.md is the draft)

Run this check before every handover. If a doc update requires changes in the parent repo, create a GitHub issue on `casehubio/parent` — do not commit to that repo directly.
